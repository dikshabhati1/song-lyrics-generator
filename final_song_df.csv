I could feel at the time. There was no way of knowing. Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing. As free as the wind. Hopefully learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing.,ENGLISH,145
"Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand.

Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Cause the night belongs to us. Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our bed 'til the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers.

The drawing of blinds. Make the hunters all line up. It's their idea of fun. And let those be forgiven. Who never owned a gun. Was it him or me. Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread.,ENGLISH,179

Who were the homestead wives?. Who were the gold rush brides?. Does anybody know?. Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?. The land was free, yet it cost their lives.. In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters. they would moan as they would read accounts of. madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief..",ENGLISH,274

'til noon when a stop was made and another child was born,. this time Susan Mollmeyer.. And gave the baby the name Alice Nevada."". Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads.. Pass the lone church spire.. Pass the talking wire from where to who knows?. There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains.. Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces.. The land was free and the price was right.. Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly.. Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family.. I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.. Who were the homestead wives?. Who were the gold rush brides?. Does anybody know?. Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?. The land was free, yet it cost their lives.. In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters. they would moan as they would read accounts of. madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief..",ENGLISH,274
"An Augist day in the hills of Spain,. a pair of children emerged from a cave.. The strangest sight there alone they stood,. with skin of green and words no one had heard.. The girl was stronger, the boy was weak,. with her new mother she learned to speak.. And wove a tale of a dying sun,. they had left darkness, a dark world come undone.. They travelled so far.. Believing they came from a star.. She fell through life, through time, through parallel lives.. The men of science, the men of fame,. the men of letters tried to explain:. Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time. to make her think she'd fallen from the sky?. A whirlwind spun them all alone,. took them from their twilight home..

There were lands to be charted and to be claimed for a crown,. when a hero was made by the length he could stay in this dangerous land of hateful hate.. Curiosity filled the heads of these, there was an upper room they had to see.. Curiosity killed the best of these for a hero's hometown welcoming.. Still they moved on and on.. Who came building missions?. Unswerving men of the cloth who gave their lives in numbers untold so that black sheep entered the fold.. Captured like human livestock, destined for slavery.. Naked, walked to the shore where great ships moored for the hellbound journies.. Bought and sold with a hateful hate.. Curiosity filled the breasts of these with some strange ecstasy.. Curiosity killed the best of these by robbing their lives of dignity.. Still they moved on and on.. Calling men of adventure for a jungle bush safari.. Come conquer the, his claws and teeth.. See death in his eyes to know you're alive.. European homesteads grew up in the colonies with civilized plans for wild hinterlands, their guns and God willing.. Such a hateful hate.. Curiosity spilled the blood of these for their spotted skins and ivory.. Curiosity filled the heads of these madmen with the lies of destiny.. Curiosity spilled the blood of these, then blotted their lives from history.. Curiosity filled the heads of these, one man claimed all that he could see.. Curiosity still entices these madmen with a lusting and a greed.. Their legacy, legacy, legacy....",ENGLISH,286

No little girl can stop her world to wait for me.. I should have known.. At your age, in a string of days the year is gone.. But in that space of time, it takes so long.. Because we can't make up for the time that we've lost, I must let those memories provide.. No little girl can stop her world to wait for me..

Barely here to tell her tale. Rolled in on a sea of disaster. Rolled out on a mainline rail. She once walked tight by my side. I'm sure she walked by you. Her striding steps could not deny. Torment from a child who knew. That in the quiet morning. there would be despair. and in the hour that followed. no one could repair.

"To think of my task is chilling. To know I was carefully building the mask. I was wearing for two years, swearing I'd tear it off. I've sat in the dark explaining to myself. that I'm straining too hard for feelings I ought to find easily. Called myself Jezebel, I don't believe. Before I say that the vows we made. Weigh like a stone in my heart. Family is family, don't let this tear us apart. You lie there, an innocent baby. I feel like the thief who is raiding your home. Entering and breaking and taking in every room. I know your feelings are tender. And that inside you the embers still glow. But I'm a shadow, I'm only a bed of blackened coal. Call myself Jezebel for wanting to leave. I'm not saying I'm replacing love for some other word. To describe the sacred tie that bound me to you. I'm just saying we've mistaken one for thousands of words. And for that mistake, I've caused you such pain that I damn that word. I've no more ways to hide that I'm a desolate and empty. hollow place inside. I'm not saying I'm replacing love for some other word. to describe the sacred tie that bound me to you. I'm not saying love's a plaything. No, it's a powerful word. inspired by strong desire to bind myself to you. How I wish that we never had tried to be man and his wife. to weave our lives into a blindfold over both our eyes",ENGLISH,256

Fear falls hard like rain again. Washing over me. You say nothing will ever change. What do i believe. You fall deep inside again. Nothing left to see. Weakness fills your heart again. You put it to rest. Chorus:. Forfeit everything. 'Cause you were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. And pray that i will not give up. I try to see your face again. A Photograph for me. Your voice calling out again. Nothing left for me. You try to find your place again. Waiting just to breathe. Weakness takes your heart again. You put it to rest. Locked inside again x3. Chorus x2. Did you forget about the things i said. Fight the lies inside your head. Deny those who try to bring you down. Kill the pain and emptiness. Find a love and lose yourself. Without this life you're just a memory. Locked inside again x3,ENGLISH,150

I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. While I was having the time of my life. I think my soul died a little every day. I always called to say I'm sorry. You said it's okay. But you should be through it all - you never walked away. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven - I just had to go home. Into the arms of my angel. Into the peace I left behind. All I had to do to save my own life. Was to look into your eyes. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I didn't have to let myself get so far gone. I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone. I didn't have to die to go to heaven. But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long. I just had to go home. I just had to go home.

And in the distance coming in view a primordial forest. A people then approached waving their hands. They were speaking in a tongue I could not understand.

Steer clear of white powder. I run into my brother give him a pound and a yodel. They know my word is bond talkin' bout the brodels. The brodels is the nazz and the nazz knows where it's at. The brodels is the nazz who knows a cat who can feed a cat. The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter. To be one who loves to be one who works. The nazz not something that can be given. The brodel is inside you it comes from within. And we're fresh dude just check my man P. He said I will not muddle my mind with impertinency. Lost a lot in vegas plays a lot of Sega. Saw a phrase that he likes and put it on his leg. And we're fresh dude just check my man D he said. Comin' in ruff and tuff all systems are tweakin'. People all over the world they must be thinkin'. All the shit that we kickin' our shoes must be stinkin'.",ENGLISH,656

"Before you're pointing at me,. There is a possibility,. You better turn that finger around. Defense comes easily. So don't you tread on me. Cause I will knock you down. Some days it seems it's not worth it. The fight in me is all gone. And I'm not trying to be perfect. To just get one damn thing done.. Before I lose control. I pick myself up off the floor.. Before you're pointing at me,. There is a possibility,. You better turn that finger around. Defense comes easily. So don't you tread on me. Cause I will knock you down. Never come a day that’ll solve you. Consequently I could never leave you. In the shadow of those living battleships, I love our canoe. I’m ready for the falls and the still waters we will find our true. Oh there’s a clock in my head. And despite what it said. Another one in the wall. We don’t agree at all. And this just gives ‘em to me. And despite what you see. You must see me as calm, but I don’t wanna give up.. Before you're pointing at me,. There is a possibility,. You better turn that finger around. Defense comes easily. So don't you tread on me. Cause I will knock you down. Woah. Ohh in the comfort of strangers. You don’t see the danger of just letting it flow. This I know.. Before you're pointing at me,. There is a possibility,. You better turn that finger around. Defense comes easily.

The base is kickin' straight to your ear man. Because it's like that so don't talk back. And if you do then you're gonna get the back slap. Down south that's an enigma. But to you it's a stupid dumb stigma. That's right it's outta sight. Let me tell you 'bout my baby. She loves me don't mean maybe. She knows what I think and I don't have to say it. I love her so I don't have to play it. We sit and drink in the sun. I raise my glass and say she's the one. Cool breeze light squeeze life. Take my advice don't think twice. Let me take you way down south. Step back I'm about to get hectic. Chalk it up as another dialectic. Hard like a jam. Smooth like a ballad. Call it what you want but I call it sound salad. A salad grown in the garden of Eden. Seekin' out pleasures like my boys in Sweden. That's right the grooves tight like. Sit back just relax, let your mind unwind. Pull your good thing close, let tranquility surround. Psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic. Grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you. Step back and think about the topic of this song.

Tanks are overfilling. Forward we crawl backwards we fall through the ebb and the flow. Living within a dream wading through the stream beyond the ebb and flow. Up late to earn the proceeds. All stressed out, working until your eyes bleed. Overtime to buy things we don? t need. Always on the go and you? re thirty thirty. Gotta make the ends and get dirty dirty. Will it ever stop will it ever end. Is it worthy. Reality of this is you go loco loco. And too much of this way and you? ll go postal postal. Happens all the time just get in line. And go comatose. The moms and pops have all closed up shop. And who can blame them? I don? t know anyone. The kids just hide scared to go outside. And just who can blame them?. At times it seems unreal. We can see but we can? t feel. And no one? s at the wheel. Born here all alone. Growing old with hearts of stone. The lights are on but no one? s home",ENGLISH,251
This song started as a rant against haters. But that'd be giving in to the instigators. If there is one thing I'd like to pull off. When someone steps with hate all I do is just scoff. You can't burn me (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. I'm in disbelief at what people will believe. All along I thought we had our hearts on our shirtsleeve. If one thing I can say as a piece of advice. Don't believe it till you see it and then see it twice. It's so funny (2x). The same force that flows through every circuit. The juice that's spent everytime you work it. Every life form is based on this simplicity. The soul that you have is electricity. You can't avoid that. Evolution is fact. We're all from the same Lucy. Despite differences you see. A call out for unity. In every province and city. What do you think we've been saying. Since we first started playing.,ENGLISH,206
"You got a wishing well within. That’s ready to begin. See how we roll. See how we roll. I’m trying to compromise. Because with me there are no lies. See how we run. It’s already begun. Now that I’m back to a pushing pen. That weighs two hundred tons. I’d like to drop it on you. And watch it all fall through. Nobody knows just what. You’re battling inside. You can hide. Nobody knows just why. Most everyone will lie. If they need to. The ones who aggravate you most. And happen to be ever close. Seem to be the ones lurching. For the same things that you are searching. The ones that make you feel ill. And you think that nature should have killed. Those you curse when you’re alone. Seem to be so close to home. (Chorus x2). Not an even field to be on. Feels like standing still for eons and eons. Stare it dead in the eye, what now?. All we can do is try to shut it down. Shut it down.",ENGLISH,176

Music: Sexton; Lyrics: Hexum/Martinez. Talkin shit like shut up and listen to me. Because cutting through the crap is my speciality. Like a bomb I'm dropping yes a ton of lead. You're trying to figure out the last thing I said. I'm a redwood I love to be a tree yes I'm a druid. My words are flowing out like a fluid. Never give in never conform. I'll be bustin' out rhymes in a triplet form. Dead leaves on the trees in spring. Can't hear the birds sing. A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening. Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver. A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver. While I doze I suppose I could get lost. With a brownskin friend claiming kin to crazy horse. I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but. I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Whiskey be spittle at the corners of my mouth. I'm rather liquored light flickers. I got the shakes and jitters. I roll I'm like raging bull bumrushin' the show. Hand to my head sway in the fire I've waded into. All alone except for the whiskey voices. Whores laught neon signs flash other choices. I stagger stumble to toast the past while I mumble. Slur my song slow porno show marquee words crumble. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. Fire water call it liquid rapture. Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature. Fire water the world's a mixture. Of broken liquored people get the picture. You're hangin' around the house with all your friends. Steady drinking smoking the green weed. And head is sort of blinking. You're going with the flow. And everybody is getting plowed. The voices and the music and the noise is getting loud. You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around. So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown. Only nineteen but you know where you can get it. So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting. By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead. You really can't remember who was the one that said. Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck. He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up. Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed. You try for conversation. But you know you're acting strange. Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone. You just keep fiending 'til the fucking break of dawn. Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver. A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver. While I doze I suppose.,ENGLISH,525

You take every bit before we see it off the rails. I think that you should know. You never cease to amaze me. You keep me from going crazy. And that's one thing I know for sure. Sometimes I see just how it all will be. Take every bit it's so easy the first straw. And this I know for sure. (Chorus). The first straw. So small it seemed impossible. The next straw. Vanished like shooting stars that fall. The last straw. There's no reason for getting there at all. Yeah. No reason to take it there at all. Yeah. The last straw can land in your mix.

And somehow I still feel the same. Step off, head out, take flight, and just run. Got five of everything but I just need one. My brain telling me what I want, I need. Got five of everything but I still proceed. Help me fill up this hole. It's gaping and out of control. It feels like I'm losing touch and it's taking its toll. When this wall isn't moving. State of things not improving. And no satisfaction in the distraction of the day. Sometimes it seems insane. To just keep pressing on. As if it will put out the flame. But still the thirst remains.

Got five of everything but I still proceed. Living in this culture can be a drag. It's just a commercial what we have. A one track mind we grab, grab, grab. We're past being crazy, call us mad. Gone is the golden egg and the goose. And the bullshit of all hell breaking loose. We gotta hit the boost. Sip on the thick juice. Disregard the bad cards. And wake the truth. Step off, head out, take flight, and just run. Got five of everything but I just need one. My brain telling me what I want, I need. Got five of everything but I still proceed.

Oh, in the company of the privileged and the nearly damned. Mixing like a cocktail of your spirit slam. In the danger zone is where you'll find me. In a certain dive so inviting. A party, after party. Til' it started to get grainy. Another, and another. What are we celebrating. There's always something not to miss. Diving back in the abyss. And it gets so very stale. But tomorrow's a new tale. In the Frolic Room. Woah. The seat I assume. Yeah. And I'm drawn to the night. And its damn neon light. Yeah",ENGLISH,307
"Chorus:. From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya. What you appear to be, you ought to know. Glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya. Delusions plaguing everybody. Makin that hybrid music back in '90 now it's on ya. I hear we were the model for the band you front we spawned ya. Finding it hard to come original we warned ya. We're shakin the white boys in New York, black girls in California. We come through hip-hop drum-n-bass and dancehall rhythms. You want our beats and lyrics you want to get them. Watchin you sink into the depths of opportunism. Missing the point, music's about love not pessimism. I'm SA moving supreme and on my team. I rock the mic with a sweet lean. And you know that started as a fact the only DJ MC gettin down like that. Metaphorically we are the chief of police you're rock n' roll. And we're positive you stole more than just the radio. Now it's 21 and we are back in control. The jammies are coming, people succumbing cuz we got the soul. Bridge:. Everyone tends to forget upon re-entry. Orbiting space quantum saints we're the only. Beginning from a planet so naturally. Gifted in the heart lies our technology. It's only right, right. Entering in a space of pure delight, light. Next contestant on this jam is, tight. Feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise. (Chorus). Don't even try it, you don't want to disrespect me. If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree. You can't make me hate you no matter how punk you act. No matter what you do I don't react. I'm a perfect example of not giving a f--k. About the catty rude people that just suck. What do you know all of the sudden, ah I usurp you. Look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do. I go back to the style I came from. It's not something you can fake son. You're a con man who's run is done. You lead a world wide web of deception. (Bridge). (Chorus).",ENGLISH,350

Firmly, I didn't lose my mind. I didn't let him break me he's just another human. Not a bit of shame in what we were doin' that day. He couldn't make us stay. We had our shit together. It don't matter whether. We sport the dread locks or a shaved head. Or if we have a sticker from the dead. I said a better verse rehearsed about the roughneck curse. Last week I keep an even keel and bow in place. And face the music every minute. Never could see my homey comin' till he passed. Funky gas by my way all the day I couldn't laugh. Oh by now I'm chill with it. Bare ass in my face I'm ok but Chad's like ""Uh-uh no he isn't"". So I proceed to hear him get loose with the. Fartin' all over my face sometimes my tummy. He fucked with my flow although I thought it funny. I probably wouldn't care if I smoked more kind bud. But that wouldn't do me shit cuz then he'd fuck me more up. Crazy ill and chillin' rude but I'ze a real cool dude. He didn't believe the day would come when he would get his top. But then one day right in front of his face I got him. He looked over said ""God damn get me some water"". The one time I hadn't wasted till I got mine. Smeared his nose with my armpit funk slime. So you get it the picture just how sick we were then. But before I jet ""Hey yo Chad sniff my finger man"". I can see a lot of people who feel like I do. I can see a lot of people who feel like I don't. I go on step lightly even when I'm heavy.

In a minute everything you have can all be straight gone. In a minute things you though were tied can come straight undone. How about some knocks on wood some so far it's so good any day. What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out. To the north and south that's what plates are about. Nature has no conscience no kindness or ill will. The dreams they had make me sad because of the vides of them. When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened. To me and my family my bro's and I were driving. The RV bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving. Zoned with no home there was fire all on it. Umm let me have my life I want it. I'm gonna let you know that I said. We're coming in kill we're coming chill. We've comin in how we will. Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal. And I say know no critical boarder cuz. We do what we want. Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font. Not one to get over sounding like the norm. Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn. All we coming with is a little bit of swing. And we go on like it ain't no thing. Omaha stylee did not think there was one. Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun. But you know we fuck up the dance since 1988. Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state. Still we're down like that x3. Makin the funk that smells of skunk. Such occasions occur back in the day. It begins you're a raw kid all the way. Son of a gun but they you drifted. All are endowed but few are gifted. At the break of dawn behaving like a spy. Lampin in the light the cold world awakens. Deeper is the light to open up the sky. Look into my eyes see the dialatin'. Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with man. Embedded in out souls it breathes out from this band We always knew. that we could. Thank you if you too felt we would. We will arise explore these worlds and find the grass roots. How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew. My dude on the one come off like Teflon. Rock your shit and you will rise on. If you're a farmer outstanding in your field say. Do as you eill do as you wish follow your bliss say. We travel round the world giving it our best. Like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest. The hammer and the chisel and the rule it compass. We forged the sword chariots of war our battle axe. There's much power in anger but loves a bigger banger.

All morning and afternoon. Now it? s all a blur. I? ve been listening to sea shells. To hear the stories that they tell. Of high times and tide swells. That have yet to occur. Backsliding down the drain. Partially taking all the blame. Chasing coins to fill the purse. Is it really better or for worse. Is it a blessing or a curse. To pass the buck. Is it a bounty or a bust. Is it precious metal or just rust. Well it seems it? s up to us. So wish us luck. I kept making a U-turn. Ended up with a sunburn. But the lesson that I learned. Was worth the skin that peeled. I climbed so many mountains. It? s not even worth counting. All the drinks in the fountain. Before it was revealed. From the copper to the kettle. The stamen to the petal. We watch the value of sand dollars crumble,ENGLISH,192

So many headz what if something would give. And kill off our race. Maybe diseases from space. Arriving from a comet. With a trail left for the planet. Say the wake it created was the start of the end. Filled with spores that were engineered. Plant pathogens. What's in the future for the view is many changes. Humans could be in danger. What would you eat to be a remainder. As your food is maimed. To take you out the frame. Some would vaporize. Some would remain. The same suckers with no cares about. The wave of the world I feel. Their lives are destined for hard times too. There's a parallel universe that might be blocked. But by emotion we put into it we could unlock. I'm not saying we could escape fate tunneling in this vast. Untranslatable energy filled of dust and ash.,ENGLISH,367

Kill parasitic hosts. We can shoulder all the karma. That came with Los Alamos. Return the sky bottle blue. Return that forgotten hue. A looking glass world. Seeing into and through you. Soul and body are my twins. The latter will give in. When the former sees the ocean. As not too cold to get in. To alien life forms. These waters are real warm. But beware we will change the weather. And create a snowstorm. Sometimes when I'm awake. I can't tell if I'm still dreaming. There's so much here at stake. When every moment is just fleeting. Sometimes when I'm awake.

Returning from the water cold alive and shining. Rock a mic in the afterlife while your moon is rising. Heatin’ up forcing steam whirling to be seen. The dark held stars are the frost of my breathing. Swimming through the darkness I’m a ghostly shark. Developing like a photograph slowly in the dark. The hearafter the action the main attraction. One love in all of this that I’m going after. Now there’s fire inside but black space surrounds you. You think ’where oh where am i’. But even your light continues. See through us see a soul we have not yet. Learned to harness see the next world inside it. We are the people of skin who left water. Inside the dark womb inside of our mother. Prone to the beat and vibe of our tribe. We catch the drift and ride moving tides. Out from a love that will keep on burning. Now see yourself to the next world returning. This life an old place we face to live again. What is it to understand the heareafter,ENGLISH,178

Time is precious as you say it is. I wanna know that we didnÃ­t miss. It goes by quickly youÃ­ll soon find out. When you fight to resist. Emotion with a fist. An irresistible force will always.

Groove as your soul sings. Spinnin' all around as we dust a melody. Welcome to this groove you can move right. We gonna take you higher not caught in the quagmire.

Illusions fadin' out an comin' on again. unwind your mind then find entire minutes abstract. the tract of sight day breaking in it. doles out my share of the world ocean and sun.

Blood running so we're gonna keep gunning till the next homecoming. I like the boogie to the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie. To the bang bang come on.,ENGLISH,316
