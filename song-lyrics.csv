"Died last night in my dreams.Walking the streets.Of some old ghost town.I tried to believe.In God and James Dean.But Hollywood sold out.Saw all of the saints.Lock up the gates.I could not enter.Walked into the flames.Called out your name.But there was no answer..And now I know my heart is a ghost town.My heart is a ghost town.My heart is a ghost town.My heart is a ghost town..Died last night in my dreams.All the machines.Had been disconnected.Time was thrown at the wind.And all of my friends.Had been disaffected.Now, I'm searching for trust.In a city of rust.A city of vampires.Tonight, Elvis is dead.And everyone's spread.And love is a satire.And now I know my heart is a ghost town.My heart is a ghost town.Ooh, my heart is a ghost town.My heart is a ghost town..There's no one left in the world.I'm gunslingin'.Don't give a fuck if I go.Down, down, down.I got a voice in my head that keeps singing.Oh, my heart is a ghost town..Ooh, my heart is a ghost town.Oh, my heart is a ghost town.(Said, my heart).My heart is a ghost town.My heart is a ghost town",Ghost Town

"In a radio interview over the weekend pop star, Adam Levine claimed that Lexington, Kentucky has the most beautiful women in the world. Why Lexington? As Adam explained it:.“I  knew a girl from Lexington, Kentucky and I visited her and her family there years ago and I thought at the time that maybe she was just an exception but she wasn’t. And I’m not saying that the women there are necessarily more physically beautiful than other women in other places but, from my experience in Lexington, the women there have the entire package, ya know? They’re not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well. The girl I knew from Lexington was sweet, caring, and beautiful all-around and I found that to be the case for a lot of women there.”",Adam on Kentucky

"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind.Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine.I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride.The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind.So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life.Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride.And when the world's against me is when I really come alive.And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride.You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs.I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun.I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up.Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become.Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me.Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree.To be caught up in the trappings of the industry.Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key.And you'll see..I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me.But with that said give me one more..Another one to take the sting away.I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay.Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs.I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong.I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell.Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well.And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps.Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun.Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run.I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become.Conversations with my father on the A14.Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams.Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me.With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans.Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'.I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud.And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed.The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now.Somehow..I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me.But with that said give me one more..Another one to take the sting away.Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay.Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.Welcome to the new show.I guess you know I've been away.But where I'm heading, who knows?.But my heart will stay the same.Welcome to the new show.I guess you know I've been away.But where I'm heading, who knows?.My pain eraser..And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser.And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser",Eraser

How's your daughter?.My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father.If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?.I'ma name her Bonnie.I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry.I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him.I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan.I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam.I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man.I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat.Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back.Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I.Got out of bed at all.The morning rain clouds up my window.And I can't see at all.And even if I could it'd all be gray.But your picture on my wall.It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance.I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans.If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to.But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew.That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old.We waited in the blisterin' cold.For you, for four hours, and you just said no.That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol.He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do.I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to.Remember when we met in Denver?.You said if I'd write you, you would write back.See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither.He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs.So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on.‘Cause I don't really got shit else.So that shit helps when I'm depressed.I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me.See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it.My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7.But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does.She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up.You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose.Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too.My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I.Got out of bed at all.The morning rain clouds up my window.And I can't see at all.And even if I could it'd all be gray.But your picture on my wall.It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans.This'll be the last package I ever send your ass.It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?.I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it.I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway.Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?.You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night"".About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'.But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?.That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'.Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy.And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call.I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall.I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!.You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me.See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk.Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk.But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you.‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too.Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now.Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!.My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I.Got out of bed at all.The morning rain clouds up my window.And I can't see at all.And even if I could it'd all be gray.But your picture on my wall.It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy.You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?.Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that.And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap.I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you.Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you.But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?.I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?.You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'.To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some.And what's this shit about us meant to be together?.That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other.I really think you and your girlfriend need each other.Or maybe you just need to treat her better.I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time.Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine.If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan.Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan.I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick.Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge.And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid.And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to.Come to think about it, his name was—it was you..Damn…",Stan

"Yeah.I know sometimes.Things may not always make sense to you right now.But ayy.What'd Daddy always tell you?.Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip.What you cryin' about?.You got me..Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad.When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had.I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh.I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry.'Cause you're scared, I ain't there.Daddy's with you in your prayers.No more cryin', wipe them tears.Daddy's here, no more nightmares.We gon' pull together through it.We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?.Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it.We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls.When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls.Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you.Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news.I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems.The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me.All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see.Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did.We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me.But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'.Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers.But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason.I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something.We have no control over, and that's what destiny is.But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep.Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream.Now hush, little baby, don't you cry.Everything's gonna be alright.Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya.Daddy's here to hold ya through the night.I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why.We fear how we feel inside.It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby.But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)..It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money.Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree.And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em.I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'.'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job.But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom.And at the time, every house that we lived in.Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block.And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar.Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college.Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it.And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart.And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart.Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back.On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment.And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara.And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD.And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me.But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me.Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it.And you and Lainie were too young to understand it.Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit.And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it.I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand.'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud.Now I'm sittin' in this empty house.Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out.To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now.Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here.Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here.I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?.Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment.Now hush, little baby, don't you cry.Everything's gonna be alright.Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya.Daddy's here to hold ya through the night.I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why.We fear how we feel inside.It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby.But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright..And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird.I'ma give you the world.I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you.I'll do anything for you to see you smile.And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine.I'ma break that birdie's neck.I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya.And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Maybe so.Never meant that far to take it though.‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes.That song I no longer play at shows.And I cringe every time it's on the radio.And I think of Nathan being placed in a home.And all the medicine you fed us and.How I just wanted you to taste your own.But now the medication's takin' over.And your mental state's deterioratin' slow.And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though.But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo.All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both.Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours.But I love you, Debbie Mathers.Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause.One thing I never asked was.Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was.Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address.But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus.Owned a collection of maps.And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas.If someone ever moved 'em from me.That you coulda bet your asses.If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em.And although one has only met their grandma once.You pulled up in our drive one night.As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers.Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you.And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness.Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and.I saw your headlights as I looked back.And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to.Thank you for being my mom and my dad.So, Mom, please accept this as a.Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to.Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to.Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten.My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'.So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that.I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom.I guess we are who we are.Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on.Maybe we took this too far.I want a new life (Start over).One without a cause (Clean slate).So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah).Well, no matter what the cost.And if the plane goes down.Or if the crew can't wake me up.Well, just know that I'm alright.I was not afraid to die.Oh, even if there's songs to sing.Well, my children will carry me.Just know that I'm alright.I was not afraid to die.Because I put my faith in my little girls.So I'll never say goodbye cruel world.Just know that I'm alright.I am not afraid to die.I guess we are who we are.Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on.Maybe we took this too far.I want a new life",Headlights

Confounded by his sport coat, she replies..).Hi!.(Realizing that she no longer recognizes him... or even appreciates the patient religious training he had given her in the past, BUDDY JONES, like a true WET T-SHIRT EMCEE type person, proceeds to say various stupid things to waste time, making the contest itself take longer, thereby giving the mongoloids squatting on the dance floor an opportunity to buy more exciting beverages. . . liquid products that will expand their consciousnesses to the point whereby they might more fully enjoy the ambiance of Miami By Night...).Where ya from?.Ah, the bus.Which one?.You know... the last tour.You know...

"But one night, at the Social Club meeting.Mary didn't show up.She was sucking cock backstage at The Armory.In order to get a pass.To see some big rock group for free..Backstage at the local Armory, MARY, in her little white dress, is wiping the remnants of her performance off the side of her mouth as LARRY (the guy from the garage who quit the band in order to make an honest living) zips up the front of his stinking boiler suit and sings to the same teen-age girls who were stomping and clapping a little while ago, as they kneel with their little pink mouths open near the crew bus, hoping to save the price of admission by performing acts of Hooverism on the jolly lads who set up the P. A. System..Hey, hey, hey all you girls in these industrial towns.I know you're prob'ly gettin' tired of all the local clowns.They never give you no respect, they never treat you nice.So perhaps you oughta' try a little friendly advice..And be a crew slut.Hey, you'll love it.Be a crew slut.It's a way of life.Be a crew slut.See the world.Don't make a fuss, just get on the bus.Crew slut.Add water, makes its own sauce.Be a crew slut.So you don't forget, call before midnite tonite.The boys in the crew are just waiting for you.You never get to move around, you never go nowhere.I know yer prob'ly gettin' tired of all the guys out there.You always wondered what it's like to go from place to place.So, darlin', take a little ride on the mixer's face..And be a crew slut.Just follow the magic footprints.Be a crew slut.Hey, you'll love it!.Be a crew slut.It's a way of life.I ain't gonna squash it and you don't need to wash it!.Crew slut.Hey, I'll buy you a pizza.Be a crew slut.Of course I'll introduce you to Warren.The boys in the crew are only waiting for you..At this point, the road crew, as all road crews must from time to time, borrow some of the big rock group's equipment and have a blues jam session, indicating to the kneeling maidens that they are endowed with a great deal of raw talent, as well as massive meat. Obviously impressed with LARRY'S ability to suck so hard on his harmonica that screeching little noises come out of it, MARY kneels again and reaches upward in gestures of supplication, listening intently as LARRY continues to sing.....Well you been to Alabama, girl, 'n Georgia too.And all the boys in the crew is bein' good to you.I know you're sayin' to yourself ""This is the way to go"".Cause when you need a little extra they will give you some mo'.Cause you're the crew slut.I'm into leather.That's good!.Crew slut.A lot of the boys in the crew love leather.And rubber?.Crew slut.Yeah, they like rubber too... shrink-tubing with a hair dryer.Trade your spot on the bench for a guy with a wrench.And be a crew slut.Ha ha ha.You like that, huh?.Crew slut.I told you you'd love it.It's a way of life!.The guys in the crew.Have got a present for you!.A present for me?.We got a present for you!.Whaddya got?.Whaddya gonna give me?.It looks just like a Telefunken U-47.You'll love it.With leather?.Eh errr, eh eh...

Seasonal anti-smut campaigns are not conducted to rid our communities of moral rot...they are conducted to give an aura of saintliness to the office-seekers who demand them. If a few key phrases are thrown into any speech (as the expert advisors explain to these various heads of state) votes will roll in, bucks will roll in, and, most importantly, power will be maintained by the groovy guy (or gal) who gets the most media coverage for his sleaze. Naturally, his friends in various businesses will do okay too.All governments perpetuate themselves through the daily commission of act which a rational person might find to be stupid or dangerous (or both). Naturally, our government is no exception... for instance, if the President (any one of them) went on TV and sat there with the flag in the background (or maybe a rustic scene on a little backdrop, plus the flag) and stared sincerely into the camera and told everybody that all energy problems and all inflationary problems had been traced to and could be solved by the abolition of music, chances are that most people would believe him and think that the illegalization of this obnoxious form of noise pollution would be a small price to pay for the chance to buy gas like the good ol' days. No way? Never happen? Records are made out of oil. All those big rock shows go from town to town in fuel-gobbling 45 foot trucks...and when they get there, they use up enormous amounts of electrical energy with their lights, their amplifiers, their PA systems...their smoke machines. And all those synthesizers...look at all the plastic they got in 'em...and the guitar picks...you name it....Joe’s Garage is a stupid story about how the government is going to try to do away with music (a prime cause of unwanted mass behavior)! It's sort of like a really cheap kind of high school play...the way it might have been done 20 years ago, with all the sets made out of cardboard boxes and poster paint. It's also like those lectures that local narks used to give (where they show you a display of all the different ways you can get wasted, with the pills leading to the weed leading to the needle, etc., etc.). If the plot of the story seems just a little bit preposterous, and if the idea of The Central Scrutinizer enforcing laws that haven't been passed yet makes you giggle, just be glad you don't live in one of the cheerful little countries where, at this very moment, music is either severely restricted...or, as it is in Iran, totally illegal.]",The Central Scrutinizer

Ho! Ho!' to you.Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside.He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride.I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh.And then ol' Santa took me up and away.Santa took me up up and away.We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below.I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show.It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said.'Little boys like you should be in bed'.So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'.And I put on Santa's hat.Then he let me hold the reins a while.We pulled up to my window.And I jumped back in my room.And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile.When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright.My parents said my window had blown open in the night.I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat.And they asked me where I got my big red hat, Yeah yeah.They asked me where I got my big red hat.Chorus.Happy Ho!

"I have never known peace.Like the damp grass that yields to me.I have never known hunger.Like these insects that feast on me..A thousand teeth.And yours among them, I know.Our hungers appeased.Our heartbeats becoming slow..We'll lay here for years or for hours.Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw.So long, we'd become the flowers.Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw..And they'd find us in a week.When the weather gets hot.After the insects have made their claim.I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you..I have never known sleep.Like this slumber that creeps to me.I have never known colour.Like this morning reveals to me.And you haven't moved an inch.Such that I would not know.If you sleep always like this.The flesh calmly going cold..We'll lay here for years or for hours.Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet.So long, we'd become the flowers.We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep..And they'd find us in a week.When the cattle show fear.After the insects have made their claim.After the foxes have known our taste.I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you.....They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours).When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers).And they'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours).When the cattle show fear (So long we become the flowers)..And they'd find us in a week.When the buzzards get loud.After the insects have made their claim.After the foxes have known our taste.After the raven has had his say.I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you.I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you.I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you",In a Week
"For starts.What a waste to say the heart could feel apart.Or feel complete, baby.Why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?.When it sings so sweet.The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?.Why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain?.When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothing's gained?..My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand.It's how I know now that you understand..There's no plan, there's no race to be run.The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun.There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come.I'll be your man if you got love to get done.Sit in and watch the sunlight fade.Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late.There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein.As Mack explained, there will be darkness again..Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard.Blue bird, I know your beat, baby.But your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like seeds.Keep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my grave.Your secret is safe with me, and if secrets were like seeds.When I'm lying under marble, marvel at flowers you'll have made.My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand.That's how I know now that you understand..There's no plan, there's no race to be run.The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song.There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come.But I'll be your man if you got love to get done.Sit in and watch the sunlight fade.Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late.There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein.As Mack explained, there will be darkness again..My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand.It's how I know now that you understand.How big the hourglass, how deep the sand.I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand..And there's no plan, there's no race to be run.The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun.There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come.But I'll be your man if you got love to get done.Sit in and watch the sunlight fade.Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late.There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein.As Mack explained, there will be darkness again",No Plan
